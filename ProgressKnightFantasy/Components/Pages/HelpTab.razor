    <MudExpansionPanels MultiExpansion="true">
        <MudExpansionPanel Text="The Journey: Quests, Training & Professions"><MudText Typo="Typo.body1" GutterBottom="true">Your saga unfolds through various activities found under "Quests & Training" and "Professions".</MudText><MudText Typo="Typo.body2">- <strong>Quests & Training:</strong> These are activities like practicing combat, studying lore, or gathering resources. Completing them grants experience in that specific activity (Task Level) and also Adventurer XP, which increases your overall Adventurer Level. Leveling up activities can unlock new ones, better professions, or new talents.</MudText><MudText Typo="Typo.body2" Class="mt-2">- <strong>Professions:</strong> Once unlocked, these are more structured roles like "Village Guard" or "Apprentice Scribe." Engaging in a profession provides a steady income (Silver Pieces) and Profession XP. Gaining enough Profession XP leads to promotions (Profession Level), which can increase income, unlock new abilities, or open paths to more advanced professions.</MudText><MudText Typo="Typo.body2" Class="mt-2">You can only focus on one activity at a time (Quest, Profession, or Combat).</MudText></MudExpansionPanel>
        <MudExpansionPanel Text="The Art of Combat: Battlegrounds"><MudText Typo="Typo.body1">The "Battlegrounds" tab is where you test your mettle against the denizens of Arda.</MudText><MudText Typo="Typo.body2">- Select a foe to engage. Your success depends on your Adventurer Level, Talents (Skills), and any equipment bonuses from the Market.<br />- Combat is turn-based. Each game tick (second), you and your opponent will exchange blows.<br />- Defeating enemies yields Silver Pieces and Adventurer XP.<br />- If you are defeated, you will lose some Silver and be ejected from combat. Heal up before trying again! Your health regenerates slowly when not in combat.</MudText></MudExpansionPanel>
        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Unveiling Talents"><MudText Typo="Typo.body1">"Talents" are your innate abilities and learned skills. They provide passive bonuses or unlock new capabilities.</MudText><MudText Typo="Typo.body2">- Talents are typically leveled up through specific activities, rewards from quests, or by spending accumulated Adventurer XP (if such a mechanic is introduced).<br />- Pay attention to what each Talent affects; some boost combat, others aid in professions or crafting.</MudText></MudExpansionPanel>
        <MudExpansionPanel Text="The Marketplace"><MudText Typo="Typo.body1">The "Market" is where you can spend your hard-earned Silver Pieces on temporary boons and equipment.</MudText><MudText Typo="Typo.body2">- Items purchased here provide bonuses for your current Age (life). These benefits are lost upon Rebirth.<br />- Some items are one-time purchases, while others can be upgraded multiple times for increasing effects.</MudText></MudExpansionPanel>
        <MudExpansionPanel Text="The Cycle of Ages: Rebirth & Ancient Power"><MudText Typo="Typo.body1">When you feel you've reached the peak of your current Age, or face insurmountable odds, you can choose to "Rebirth" from the Rebirth tab.</MudText><MudText Typo="Typo.body2">- Rebirthing resets most of your progress: Adventurer Level, Silver, Task/Profession levels, and Market items.<br />- However, you gain <strong>Ancient Power</strong> based on your achievements in that Age (primarily your Adventurer Level and time taken).<br />- Ancient Power is a permanent currency used to acquire powerful "Echoes of Power" (Perks). These perks provide significant, lasting bonuses that affect all future Ages.<br />- Your Talents (Skills), total Ancient Power, and unlocked Echoes of Power are retained through Rebirths.</MudText></MudExpansionPanel>
        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Trials of Ascendance"><MudText Typo="Typo.body1">For seasoned adventurers, "Trials" offer unique challenges. Undertaking a Trial imposes specific restrictions on your current Age.</MudText><MudText Typo="Typo.body2">- If you successfully Rebirth while a Trial is active and its conditions are met, you'll receive a greater amount of Ancient Power for that Age.<br />- Completing a Trial for the first time often grants a unique, permanent reward, such as unlocking a new Echo of Power or a small stat boost.</MudText></MudExpansionPanel>
